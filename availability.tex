\subsection*{Operating system}

    Perprof-py is developed and actively tested on Unix platforms, however, it
    is also possible to run it on Windows, removing some features.

\subsection*{Programming language}

    The project was made entirely with python3.

\subsection*{Additional system requirements}

    No additional hardware requirement are necessary.

\subsection*{Dependencies}

    Perprof-py depends on the Python packages matplotlib-1.3.1, nose-1.3.0,
    numpy-1.8.0, pyparsing-2.0.1, python-dateutil-2.2, six-1.4.1, tornado-3.1.1
    and pyyaml. Additionally, if the user wants the PDF image from the LaTeX
    version, it also requires pdflatex.
