A very important part of research in optimization field is to benchmark
optimization packages, not only because it is one of the ways to compare
solvers, but also because it allows one to uncover deficiencies that could
be overlooked while developing a new solver. During benchmarking, one can
obtain a large amount of  informations, like CPU time, number of functions
evaluations, number of iterations and much more. These informations, if
presented as tables, can be difficult to be analyzed, due, for instance, to
large amount of data.  Therefore, researchers started testing and developing
tools to better process and understand optimization benchmark data. One of
the most widespread tools is \emph{Performance Profile} graphics proposed by
\textcite{Dolan:2002du}. In this context, we implemented a free software
that makes Performance Profile graphics using data provided by user in a
friendly manner. This software produces graphics in PDF using \LaTeX\ with
PGF/TikZ~\cite{TikZ} and \texttt{pgfplots}~\cite{pgfplots} packages, and in
PNG using \texttt{matplotlib}~\cite{Hunter:2007} and it can also be easily
extended to be used with other plots libraries. The software is implemented
in Python3 with support for internationalization and is under GPL (General
Public License) Version 3.
