A very important part of research in Mathematical Optimization field is to benchmark
optimization packages because it is one of the ways to compare
solvers.
During benchmarking, one usually
obtains a large amount of information, like CPU time, number of functions
evaluations, number of iterations and much more. This information, if
presented as tables, can be difficult to be analyzed and compared, due, for instance, to
large amount of data.  Therefore, researchers started developing and testing
tools to better process and understand optimization benchmark data. One of
the most widespread tools  is the \emph{Performance Profile} graphics proposed by
\textcite{Dolan:2002du}. In this context, we implemented a free software
that makes Performance Profile graphics in a user-friendly manner. This software produces graphics in PDF using LaTeX with
PGF/TikZ~\cite{TikZ} and PGFPLOTS~\cite{pgfplots} packages, in
PNG using matplotlib~\cite{Hunter:2007}, and in HTML using
Boken~\cite{url:bokeh} and it can also be easily
extended to be used with other plots libraries. The software is implemented
in Python 3 with support for internationalization and is under GPL (General
Public License) Version 3.
