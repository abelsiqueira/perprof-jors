Performance profile graphics are widely used in the nonlinear optimization
community being the most accepted comparison method.
Nevertheless, on some derivative-free optimization researches,  a new data-driven comparison is being used,
the Data Profile \cite{bib:more2009benchmarking} which is a modification of 
\citeauthor{Dolan:2002du}'s performance profile, and that we consider to add to our code. 
\textcite{bib:mahajan2012solving} also improves the performance profile by considering
a performance ratio between 0 and 1, and this improvement is also marked for
future additions. Even without these additions, our software is sure to be a great addition for
researchers on the optimization community.
