Performance profile graphics are widely used in the nonlinear optimization
community being the most accepted comparison method.
The derivative-free optimization area is using a new data-driven comparison,
the data profile (\cite{bib:more2009benchmarking}) which is a modification of the
performance profile, and that we consider to add to our code.
\textcite{bib:mahajan2012solving} also improves the performance profile by considering
a performance ratio between 0 and 1, and this improvement is also marked for
future additions.
Even without these additions, out software is sure to be a great addition for
researchers.
